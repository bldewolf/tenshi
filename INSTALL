To install tenshi:

Add a user and group named tenshi (or hack the Makefile and change
tenshi_user/tenshi_group).

As root:

$ make install

Edit the config in /etc/tenshi/tenshi.conf

Please Read The Fine Manual once through before running tenshi to make sure you
understand whats going on.

Copy the tenshi.<distro>-init to wherever your init scripts live. Currently we
only have init scripts for Gentoo and Solaris but we would be very happy to
accept init scripts for other distros.

Add tenshi to whatever run levels you need it to run in.

To start run as root:

$ /etc/init.d/tenshi start

(or whatever is appropriate for your Distro, again, comments welcome :)

Thats it!

tenshi should now email you reports as per your configuration.
