- What's tenshi?

tenshi is a log monitoring program, designed to watch one or more log files for 
lines matching user defined regular expressions and report on the matches. The 
regular expressions are assigned to queues which have an alert interval and a 
list of mail recipients.

Please read the example tenshi.conf and tenshi.8 man page for usage 
instructions.

tenshi was formerly known as wasabi. The name was changed to tenshi after we
were informed that wasabi is a registered trademark relating to another piece 
of software.

It should be noted that tenshi is basically a perl rewrite of Oak 
(http://www.ktools.org).

- Requirements

This program uses 'tail' which should be included in your distribution. 
It also requires Net::SMTP module for mailing reports which should be included
in your perl installation, otherwise you can grab it at http://www.cpan.org or 
using the CPAN shell (`perl -e shell -MCPAN`).
